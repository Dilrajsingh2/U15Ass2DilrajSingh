      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester</strong> was founded by a group of dedicated teachers who shared a common vision—to establish a Slovak educational and cultural centre that truly makes a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a passion for teaching, culture, and community-building, we worked tirelessly to create a space where Slovak families could access quality education and cultural activities. After months of hard work, we were proud to become a registered charity on <strong>9th September 2024</strong>, marking a significant step in our journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our official launch on <strong>15th September</strong> was a proud moment, celebrated in collaboration with the Faculty of Education from Univerzita Mateja Bela and the Association of Slovak Schools and Community Centres in the UK. Since then, we have continued to grow, supporting Slovak-speaking families, students, and individuals who wish to learn, connect, and celebrate Slovak culture together.
