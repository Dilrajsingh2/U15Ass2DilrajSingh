      <h2>Academic Terms</h2>
      <p>At <strong>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester</strong>, we divide our academic year into four terms: Autumn, Winter, Spring, and Summer. This structure allows us to build learning themes and activities around seasonal and cultural events, while also ensuring alignment with South Manchester (Trafford Council) school holidays.</p>
      
      <h3>Saturday Slovak Language Lessons</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Morning (AM) Sessions:</strong> 10:00 – 12:00 at The Firs Primary School</li>
        <li><strong>Afternoon (PM) Sessions:</strong> 14:00 – 16:00 at Sale High School</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although we primarily serve South Manchester, we welcome students from all areas.</p>
