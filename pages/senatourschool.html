      <h2>Supporting Every Learner</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>Slovenské Vzdelávacie Centrum – South Manchester</strong>, we believe that every child learns differently, and we want all our students to feel comfortable, supported, and engaged in their Slovak language journey. We know that some children may need a bit of extra help—whether it’s with language processing, attention, communication, or other learning challenges. That’s why we make sure our lessons are adaptable and inclusive so that everyone can learn at their own pace and in their own way.
      </p>
      <h3>How We Support Our Students</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>A Flexible and Supportive Learning Environment</strong> – We recognize that children have different learning needs, and we adapt our lessons to ensure everyone feels included and valued.</li>
        <li><strong>A Curriculum That Works for All</strong> – Our SEN specialist, Ingrid, helps shape our teaching approach so that students with different learning styles can follow along with ease.</li>
        <li><strong>Interactive and Hands-On Learning</strong> – We use games, visual materials, music, and movement to make Slovak learning fun and accessible for all children.</li>
        <li><strong>Patience, Encouragement, and Individual Attention</strong> – Our small class sizes allow us to give extra support to those who need it.</li>
      </ul>
